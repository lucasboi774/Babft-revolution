<h5> (based on the movie Black Adam) </h5>

<BODY>
  
  <p> The movie Black Adam is about a man who get blessed with powers from the 5 wizards of the world and then uses it to fight back guys, protect villages and stuff. </p>
  <p> I like this movie because it has very cool fighting scenes, cool powers and it is interesting. </p>
  <p> My opinion about this movie is that it is really cool and funny and I recommend it. </p>
